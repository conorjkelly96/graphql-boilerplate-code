## Quickstart

Simply navigate to the boilerplate code located in the [index.js](https://github.com/conorjkelly96/graphql-boilerplate-code/blob/main/src/index.js) file located in the `src` directory of this GitHub repository.

## Official Documentation

Apollo GraphQL official has released a step by step server guide, which can be found [here.](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/)

## Contributing

The GraphQL boilerplates are maintained by the GraphQL community, with official support from the [Apollo](https://blog.apollographql.com/) teams.
